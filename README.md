###### Most of you probably utilize your web browser's autofill/form fill feature. It can be a big time saver, automatically entering data like your name, address, and phone number on the lengthy check-out screens you encounter when you're shopping online. If you're not careful, though, it could also be spilling your private information to a malicious third party. Security researcher Biswajeet has put together a proof-of-concept website that shows how a visitor can be tricked into spilling the data he or she has stored in a browser's autofill system. All it takes is couple of bits of information. As inconvenient as it may be from time to time, there's a simple way to protect yourself from this kind of attack: disable form autofill in your browser or password/browser data manager. If you don't want to get quite that drastic, make sure  you fill out those forms manually on sites that you don't trust 100%.
